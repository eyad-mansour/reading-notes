SQL NoSQL
SQL databases are table based databases databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
SQL databases have predefined schema databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
databases are vertically scalable databases are horizontally scalable
databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful database, queries are focused on collection of documents
databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Give a real world example.
ans--) For high transactional based application: SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data

Q-) What does SQL stand for?

ans--) structured Query language

Q-) What is a relational database?

ans--) it is the connection between tables in the database

Q-) What type of structure does a relational database work with?

ans--) one to one, one to many and many to many

Q-) What is a ‘schema’?

ans--) defines how data is organized within a relational database; this is inclusive of logical constraints such as, table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities

Q-) What is a NoSQL database?

ans--) non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model.

Q-) How does it work?

ans--) these systems implement a simple data model that pairs a unique key with an associated value

Q-) What is inside of a Mongo database?

ans--) In MongoDB, databases hold one or more collections of documents. To select a database to use, in mongoshLinks to an external site., issue the use <db> statement

Q-) Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

ans--) there are some limitations of SQL Databases that have been observed over the years which are overcome with NoSQL Database options such as MongoDB. MongoDB offers faster query processing but with an increased load and system requirements.

Q-) What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

ans--) databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.
