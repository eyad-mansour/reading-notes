# Redux

Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions". It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.

## Installing

### Redux Toolkitâ€‹

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

### Rdux core

npm install redux

## Why should i use redux?

Redux helps you manage "global" state - state that is needed across many parts of your application.
The patterns and tools provided by Redux make it easier to understand when, where, why, and how the state in your application is being updated, and how your application logic will behave when those changes occur. Redux guides you towards writing code that is predictable and testable, which helps give you confidence that your application will work as expected.

## When Should I Use Redux?

Redux helps you deal with shared state management, but like any tool, it has tradeoffs. There are more concepts to learn, and more code to write. It also adds some indirection to your code, and asks you to follow certain restrictions. It's a trade-off between short term and long term productivity.

#### Redux is more useful when:

- You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app
- The app state is updated frequently over time
- The logic to update that state may be complex
- The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people

### Redux Application Data Flow

- State describes the condition of the app at a specific point in time
- The UI is rendered based on that state
- When something happens (such as a user clicking a button), the state is updated based on what occurred
- The UI re-renders based on the new state

### For Redux specifically, we can break these steps into more detail:

- Initial setup:

  - A Redux store is created using a root reducer function
  - The store calls the root reducer once, and saves the return value as its initial state
  - When the UI is first rendered, UI components access the current state of the Redux store, and use that data to decide what to render. They also subscribe to any future store updates so they can know if the state has changed.

- Updates:
  - Something happens in the app, such as a user clicking a button
  - The app code dispatches an action to the Redux store, like dispatch({type: 'counter/increment'})
  - The store runs the reducer function again with the previous state and the current action, and saves the return value as the new state
  - The store notifies all parts of the UI that are subscribed that the store has been updated
  - Each UI component that needs data from the store checks to see if the parts of the state they need have changed.
  - Each component that sees its data has changed forces a re-render with the new data, so it can update what's shown on the screen
