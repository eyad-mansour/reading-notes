# deliberate practice

Improving your hard technical skills makes all the software you build better. It exposes you to new opportunities, expands your knowledge into multiple fields and ultimately allows you to do more things with computers.

How much of the software you build really pushes you outside your comfort zone? How much of it is the same thing you were building last year with different names?

Your highest rate of learning was at the beginning of your career. You spent hours trying to fix incomprehensible errors. You had no idea how to implement a simple web form but muddled through and figured it out as you went along. You had to force yourself to learn SQL with it's horrible syntax.

When's the last time you had to really dig deep to solve a technical problem? After a few years as a web developer, opportunities for really pushing yourself come few and far between. You can't rely on your day job to continually challenge you.

That's where deliberate practice comes in. Deliberate practice can be summarized as:

Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individualâ€™s performance.
